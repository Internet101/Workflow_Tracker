# Workflow_Tracker
an app to make my life easier
I am currently working full time and this is a side project, one that i hope i can implement in my work life.
keeping track of all completed contracts, filing any information regarding issues we come across as a team and even tracking financials, 
being able to keep track of revenue and expenses, just having a running statement of comprehensive income would really help us grow as a company.
i install fibre for a living, its not creating anything cool or interesting, but it does build the fibre optics infrestucture around the UK while paying the bills so it's not nothing.
this is my first major project, i played around with a few basic programs that you can see in my repository.
I HAVE USED CHAT GPT, i know im a schmuck- but i needed to build out the skeloten of this project.
i'm studying Python, HTML and CSS, using youtubue tutorials, SoloLearn and various forums; im thinking of switching the from flask to react- stoll to be decided.

if anyone comes across this and feels the urge to say something, please do, any and all information is greatly appreciated.
